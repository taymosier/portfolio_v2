I have built full stack applications in the past; both front-end and back-end positions are suitable. As a self-taught developer coming from a business/marketing background, I hope to find a mentor who will point out the weak areas of my technical knowledge."

Once I have “earned my stripes,” I hope to have a normal forty-hour workweek. The option to work remotely would be nice, however I am not requiring that in the positions I consider. "
